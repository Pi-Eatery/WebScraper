üìñ Overview
This project is a starting point for my Python scripting skills to go public. This script is designed to teach web scraping while remaining conscientious and ethical. It uses the requests and BeautifulSoup 4 libraries to parse HTML content, demonstrating how to reliably extract data points while being mindful of potential security vulnerabilities like exposed credentials in comments.

This script was developed as an educational and baseling tool to move beyond basic functionality and build a scraper that is usable for professional work.

‚ú® Core Features
Targeted Data Extraction: Uses specific CSS selectors to find and output the requested HTML tags and CSS selectors.

Robust Searching: Iterates through lists of elements to find data, allowing for flexibility.

Security Scanning: Checks for revealed secrets and alerts the user of them when found.

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

pip (Python package installer)

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/pi-eatery/webscraper.git](https://github.com/pi-eatery/webscraper.git)
cd webscraper


Create and activate a virtual environment:

On macOS / Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


On Windows:

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate


Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage
Place the HTML file you wish to scrape into the project's root directory (e.g., example.html).

Update the with open(...) file path inside BasicWebScrape.py to point to your file.

Run the script from your terminal:

python BasicWebScrape.py


‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Considerations & Disclaimer
Web scraping is a powerful tool that comes with significant responsibilities. This script is intended for educational purposes on controlled files or websites that explicitly permit scraping.

Always check robots.txt: Before scraping any live website, you must check the robots.txt file (e.g., www.example.com/robots.txt) to understand the rules and limitations for bots.

Be Respectful: Do not overload servers with rapid, aggressive requests. Introduce delays between your requests to avoid impacting the site's performance for other users.

Do Not Misuse Data: Only collect public data and use it for its intended purpose. Be aware of privacy concerns and personal information.

The author of this script is not responsible for any misuse or for any actions taken against users who violate the terms of service of any website. Scrape responsibly.
