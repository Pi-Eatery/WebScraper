# **üõ°Ô∏è Secure Web Scraper**

A foundational Python script for learning web scraping with a strong emphasis on security, ethics, and robust coding practices.

## **‚ú® Core Features**

- **üéØ Targeted Data Extraction:** Uses specific CSS selectors to find and extract data from known HTML tags, IDs, and classes.
- **üí™ Robust Searching:** Iterates through lists of elements to find data, rather than relying on brittle, fixed positions.
- **üîê Security Scanning:** Actively searches for and flags sensitive information (like API keys) found within HTML comments.
- **üì¶ Professional Structure:** Includes a requirements.txt and .gitignore for clean, reproducible setups in a virtual environment.

## **üöÄ Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- git

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   git clone [https://github.com/pi-eatery/webscraper.git](https://github.com/pi-eatery/webscraper.git)
   cd webscraper

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   - On macOS / Linux:
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate

   - On Windows:
     python -m venv venv
     .\venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install the required packages:**
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage**

1. Place the HTML file you wish to scrape into the project's root directory (e.g., example.html).
2. Update the with open(...) file path inside BasicWebScrape.py to point to your target file.
3. Run the script from your terminal:
   python BasicWebScrape.py

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Considerations & Disclaimer**

Web scraping is a powerful tool that comes with significant responsibilities. This script is intended for educational purposes on controlled files or websites that explicitly permit scraping.

- **Always check robots.txt**: Before scraping any live website, you **must** check the robots.txt file (e.g., www.example.com/robots.txt) to understand the rules and limitations for bots.
- **Be Respectful**: Do not overload servers with rapid, aggressive requests. Introduce delays between your requests to avoid impacting the site's performance for other users.
- **Do Not Misuse Data**: Only collect public data and use it for its intended purpose. Be aware of privacy concerns and personal information.

The author of this script is not responsible for any misuse or for any actions taken against users who violate the terms of service of any website. **Scrape responsibly.**
